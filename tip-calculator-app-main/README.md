### What I learned

This project was a good exercise to test my HTML&CSS and JavaScript skills even more. I've worked on form validation and in real time DOM manipulation, which tourned out pretty good.

I want to solidify my understanding in Javascript even more, so from now own I am going to use these 3 skills: HTML, CSS, JS together to create awesome designs
