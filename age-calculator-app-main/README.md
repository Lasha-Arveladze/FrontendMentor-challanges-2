- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my first project using Javascript. It was quite interesting one as to work with this language in real life, without a course is whole different world. There were many challenges, but with hard work and research I managed to overcome them and gain an understanding with form validations and Date() object in javascript.

### Continued development

I want to solidify my understanding in Javascript even more, so from now own I am going to use these 3 skills: HTML, CSS, JS together to create awesome designs
