## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my next project using Javascript. There were many challenges building HTML-CSS and JavaScript as well. Working with position: absolute, relative was quite a good experience and it taught me a lot. To implement slider logic in Javascript was a lot challenging then i expected, but in the end I think it tourned out right. Of course, there is always a room for improvement and think that you will find a lot that needs to be improved, so let me hear your oppinions.

### Continued development

I want to solidify my understanding in Javascript even more, so from now own I am going to use these 3 skills: HTML, CSS, JS together to create awesome designs
